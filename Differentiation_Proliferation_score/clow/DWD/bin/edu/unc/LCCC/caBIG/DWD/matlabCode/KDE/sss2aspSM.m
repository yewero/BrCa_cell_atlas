function sss2aspSM(n,m,nres,zerosize) 
% SSS2ASPSM, Function for SSS2, this overlays all 0's, on the current image.
%     Intended to be used by SSS2, when the Effective Sample Size is
%     nowhere large enough.
%   Steve Marron's matlab function
% Inputs:
%           n - number of rows in image
%           m - number of columns in image
%        nres - resolution of SSS symbols:    (called ivitype(2) in sss1.m)
%                   1  -  1x1 single pixels
%                   2  -  2x2 blocks
%    zerosize - Size of Zeros to Plot
% Outputs:
%       Only graphics added to current axes.
